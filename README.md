# 🏨 Hotel Room Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Objective
Build a regression model to predict the Average Daily Rate (ADR) for hotel bookings using historical booking attributes.

## 📊 Dataset
- Hotel booking records including:
  - Booking date, stay duration, customer type, season, meal plan, etc.
  - Target variable: `ADR` (Average Daily Rate)

## 🧠 Features Used
- Lead time
- Number of adults/children
- Market segment
- Season/month of booking
- Room type, booking changes, etc.

## 🛠️ Model
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Target Variable:** `ADR`
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - R² Score
  - RMSE

## 📈 Results
- Linear Regression provided interpretable, baseline-level accuracy.


## 📌 Conclusion
Linear Regression offers a transparent way to model room pricing behavior based on historical patterns. While not the most powerful model, it enables valuable insight into pricing trends and seasonality for hotel revenue optimization.
